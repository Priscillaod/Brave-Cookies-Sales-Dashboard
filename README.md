## Brave Cookies Sales Performance Dashboard (Excel)
A clean, powerful Excel dashboard that delivers executive-level insight with zero coding, just smart design and sharp analytics.





# Project Overview

This project presents a dynamic Excel dashboard created for Brave Cookies, a fictional multinational bakery brand. The dashboard provides an executive-level summary of key sales and profit trends across cookie types and global markets. Built to support strategic decision-making, it showcases Excel's power for business intelligence and reporting automation.


# Business Objective

Brave Cookies needed a centralised view of product and regional performance to answer questions like:

- Which cookie types are most profitable?
- What regions contribute most to revenue and growth?
- How do monthly sales and profit trends evolve across the year?

This dashboard helps stakeholders identify high-performing markets, track product profitability, and monitor seasonal trends to optimise marketing and distribution strategies.


# Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, Slicers, Line & Bar Charts, Custom Formatting)
- Dataset Source: Sample data from Kevin Stratvert (YouTube)
- Design Style: Layout with filters, multi-sheet structure, and branded color scheme


# Key Features and Visuals
- Section	Description
- Slicers	Filters by Year, Month, Country, and Cookie Type
- Profit by Market & Cookie	Stacked bar chart showing profit contribution by product and country
- Units Sold Each Month	Line chart showing seasonal spikes in volume (notably Oct–Dec)
- Profit by Month	Reveals profitability fluctuations over the calendar year
- Pivot Tables	Underlying summaries for easy audit and drill-down


# Business Insights

- Top Market: India generated the highest profit ($606K), largely driven by Chocolate Chip sales.
- Top Product: Chocolate Chip cookies consistently outperformed others across all markets.
- Sales Surge: Units sold peaked in October (201K) and remained high into Q4, suggesting strong seasonality.
- Underperforming Segments: Fortune Cookies contributed the least to profit—potentially requiring pricing or promotion review.
- Profit Growth: October showed the highest monthly profit (£484K), followed by a steady Q4.


# Recommendations

- Focus on Q4 Promotions: Ramp up production and marketing ahead of peak sales months (Oct–Dec).
- Expand Chocolate Chip Range: Given its profitability, consider new flavors or combo packs.
- Reassess Fortune Cookie Strategy: Explore bundling or market repositioning to improve margin.
- Replicate India’s Strategy: Analyze sales tactics in India and consider applying them in underperforming regions.
